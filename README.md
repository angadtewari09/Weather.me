# Weather.me

## Description
This project is about building a web application to show a weather forecast using weather API from external services like openweathermap.org .
This allows you to swarch for a specific city and get the current temperature , the maximum and the minimum temperature of that place for that day ,what the temperature feels like , the wind speed and the humidity.
It also has a toggle button to switch between the Centigrade scale and the Fahrenheit scale.
All you need to do is type in the name of the city and click on the search button.
